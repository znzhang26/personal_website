        In aeronautical manufacturing, drilling alters material properties and induces residual stress, accelerating fatigue. Given that fatigue accounts for over 55% of in-service failures, minimizing it during manufacturing is crucial for enhancing aircraft performance and longevity. To develop an automated drilling system that meets stringent hole detection requirements, a binocular vision detection module has been integrated. This module provides real-time positional feedback, aiding in the correction of subsequent drilling steps. In this project, I established a binocular vision system. This involved photographing newly drilled holes and preprocessing images from both left and right cameras independently. The system then extracts the edge of the drill hole and implements ellipse detection to determine the real-world center coordinates of the hole. These coordinates serve as reference input for adjusting the next drilling step. Future efforts will focus on integrating the vision module with the automated drilling system to enable real-time detection and enhanced accuracy.</br>
