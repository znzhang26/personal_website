        <b>Introduction</b>: The automatic driving system has entered the automobile market. However, at present, only one agent — either a human driver or an automation system — can control a vehicle during a specific time interval. This means when drivers wish to alter the route planned by the automatic system, their only option is to completely deactivate the automatic driving system and switch to traditional driving. In such scenarios, the automatic driving system loses the opportunity to learn and adapt to the driver's intentions within its algorithm. To address this, we propose a continuous control sharing scheme where both human and automation can issue a takeover request to the steering wheel: the human through biomechanics (squeezing the steering wheel) and the automation through proportional gain (controlling fluid mass in the bladders). This is facilitated by force sensing and shape change in the two fluid bladders attached to the steering wheel. Additionally, this haptic steering wheel enables two-way communication between human and automation. By sensing the change in the inflatable shape, the driver can gauge the extent of control exercised by the automation. Conversely, the automation can detect pressure changes when the driver squeezes the wheel. Furthermore, the automation can communicate a denied takeover request by maintaining the wheel's inflated state and can adjust its impedance in real-time along the orthogonal steering axis, ensuring smoother transitions of authority.</br>
